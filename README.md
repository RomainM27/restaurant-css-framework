# Woods Burger - Food truck

## Training at Becode.org (jan - oct 2021)

> As part of our training at Becode, we had to create a website for a restaurant.
> 
> This restaurant was fictive, but the choice of food was ours!
> 
> This project took place at the very beginning of our training : 26-27-28 january 2021 and was a team project.


## Project

> So, we decided to realize a website about a food truck named "Woods Burger".
> 
> As the name suggests, this truck travels through the big cities of Wallonia to sell succulent hamburgers made with love & quality local products!
